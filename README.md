# HeartGuard: Heart Disease Prediction

## About Dataset
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for a significant number of premature deaths. Heart failure, often a consequence of CVDs, can be effectively managed with early detection and treatment. This dataset contains 11 features that can be utilized to predict the likelihood of heart disease, aiding in early intervention and management.

## Attribute Information
- **Age**: Age of the patient [years]
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
- **ChestPainType**: Chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
- **RestingBP**: Resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
- **FastingBS**: Fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
- **RestingECG**: Resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: ST-T wave abnormality, LVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy]
- **MaxHR**: Maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
- **ExerciseAngina**: Exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise [Numeric value]
- **ST_Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: Upsloping, Flat: Flat, Down: Downsloping]
- **HeartDisease**: Output class [1: Heart disease, 0: Normal]

## Context
Early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases are crucial for reducing mortality rates. This dataset combines information from multiple heart disease datasets, resulting in a comprehensive dataset suitable for research purposes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms on this dataset, predictive models can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

## Source
The dataset is created by combining five heart disease datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, including observations from the Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Stalog datasets. It comprises 918 observations after removing duplicates and serves as the largest combined heart disease dataset available for research purposes.
